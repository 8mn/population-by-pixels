# Population by pixels

Image generator and visualizer based on [WWF ads](https://www.oneclub.org/awards/theoneshow/-award/6984/population-by-pixel) made by Japanese designer [Mikami Yoshiyuki](https://japan-designers.jp/en/profile/303/) in 2008.
Each pixel represents a single animal, as the population numbers rise and fall the image will either become more legible or disappear completely.

## What it does
- Helps you to visualize population of endangered and vulnerable species through an image. Each pixel represents a single animal, as the population numbers rise and fall the image will either become more legible or disappear completely.
- It also has a slider through which you can simulate a population number

## How we built it
- made a p5.js script to represent individual pixel as an animal.
- population data is used from WWF website

## Challenges we ran into
- This was my first time working with p5.js. After building several rough sketches and looking at hundreds of examples, I built the somewhat satisfactory first version.
- Making the formula which exactly calculates number of pixels to show according to the population of species
- Syncing the slider with the changes in image

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Building an interactive data visualization  

## What we learned
- Working with p5.js
- visualizing number puts things in perspective
- Working with individual pixels!

## What's next for population by pixel
- Making and deploying a website so that anyone can view
- Using data like year to show the progress or decline
- Adding other animals
- Making it like a dashboard including all endangered and vulnerable animals with regularly updated data would be cool.
- I can also add videos of animals for visualizations.
